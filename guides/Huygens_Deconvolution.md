## Introduction
Optical systems like microscopes produce images that are not perfect but degraded by blur and noise. Technically, the blur is the result of a **convolution** of the "ideal" image with the so called point spread function.

The **point spread function (PSF)** is the 3D image produced by a point-like source. Its shape and size depends on the microscope type, wavelength, objective, refractive index of immersion and sample medium etc. The PSF can be measured experimentally with sub-resolution beads or be calculated.

**Deconvolution** is an image restoration process that recovers an image which was degraded by convolution. It inverts the convolution process. 
For more details on deconvolution also see the [documentation from Huygens](https://svi.nl/Huygens-Deconvolution).

Deconvolution **increases image quality and image resolution**. It improves contrast and reduces noise and background signal. Using deconvolution is very important for colocalization analysis and precise shape measurements.

### Huygens software
{: .no_toc } 

[Huygens](https://svi.nl/Huygens-Professional) is a deconvolution software available at CBG. Additional capabilities include chromatic aberration correction and colocalization analysis. 

#### **Features of Huygens at CBG**
{: .no_toc } 
* Currently licenses are available for deconvolution of images acquired with **confocal, spinning disk, widefield** systems. 
* Two versions of Huygens are available:
  * **HuygensPro**: GUI-based, useful for exploration of new data
  * **Huygens Remote Manager**: browser-based, useful for batch processing 
* HuygensPro (content of this how-to guide) is installed on a linux server and can be accessed remotely from your own laptop.

### Requirements for accessing HuygensPro
{: .no_toc } 
* **Internal CBG network**: You need to be connected to the internal network. If working from a different network, connect via VPN. <br>
* **Login credentials**: Contact [IPF](mailto:ipf@mpi-cbg.de) to obtain the login information to access HuygensPro.



This how-to guide is about a basic deconvolution pipeline using **HuygensPro** and a **calculated point spread function**. 

## Step-by-step
The step-by-step section is split into (1) data acquisition, (2) data transfer (3) deconvolution.


> *Important: Deconvolution is not a one-click-done process. Always inspect your results critically for quality and artifacts and redo the analysis with different parameters if needed.*
> 

## 1. Data acquisition
* Correct data acquisition is very important for good deconvolution.
* General rule of thumb: **give more importance to sampling than signal**, i.e. noise is acceptable but not undersampling.
* If you plan to use measured PSF, make sure to acquire fluorescent bead images as well.

#### **General guidelines**
{: .no_toc } 
* **High spatial sampling**
   * Make sure you sample your data well, especially in Z. Use the [Nyquist calculator](https://svi.nl/NyquistCalculator) to get the ideal Nyquist sampling rate.
	> *Confocal: up to 40% undersampling is acceptable as compared to the ideal sampling.* <br>
	> *Widefield: stick to the ideal sampling rate as much as possible.*
* **Accept noise**
	* high sampling is more important than avoiding noise.
	> *LSM acquisition: for very low intensity: use accumulation or photon count instead of averaging.*
* **Z-stack range** 
	* image till the edge of the object + ½ PSF above and below sample. Especially important for Widefield. 
* **No saturation and clipping**
	* Avoid saturating your image, the image does not have to look pretty!
* **Metadata**
	* Save the image in a format that keeps all the meta data.
	* Use sufficiently high bit depth (typically 16-bit).

#### **Deconvolution is not possible if:**
{: .no_toc } 
* the volume is 2x undersampled, and/or
* image is heavily saturated or clipped. 

**Tip 1**: Check the [Huygens webpage](https://svi.nl/AcquisitionPitfalls) for more details on proper image acquisition (ask IPF for login).

**Tip 2**: Talk to your microscopists before deconvolution, involve the image analysts as well.

## 2. Data transfer
* Your raw data has to be transferred to our Huygens computer for processing.
* This can be done by mounting the Huygens computer as project space:
	* Mac users:
		* Start *Finder*. 
		* In the menu bar click on *Go* and select *Connect to Server...⌘K* 
		* Type `smb://lmfuser@huygens-srv1.mpi-cbg.de/UserData`
		* Click *Connect*.
	* Windows users:
		* Open the *Explorer* (not Internet Explorer).
		* In the path bar type `\\lmfuser@huygens-srv1.mpi-cbg.de\UserData`.
		* Press enter. 
* Enter the login credentials (obtained from IPF).
* Once connected, navigate to the folder named *UsersDataFolders*.
* Create a folder of your name.
* Copy **only** the data that needs to be processed to this folder.
* **After performing deconvolution, make sure to transfer back the data to your local machine or project space.**
> *Important: The data on Huygens computer is not backed up and will be cleared on a regular basis*.
>

  <tr align="center" valign="top"> 
     <td>(c)<br><img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_3c_tifseriesmenu.png"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Step 4: Inspect your image
{: .no_toc } 
* After opening a file, you should find a new image thumbnail in the main work space.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_4_imagethumbnail.png" width="400">

* Click on the thumbnail to select the image. 
* Once you select:
   * the right window is updated with the image histogram and other information, and
   * the windows on the left show multiple renderings of the selected image. 
* Right click on the thumbnail and select *2D Visualization > Slicer*. Alternative: *Visualization > Slicer*
* The *Slicer* view which allows you to check if the data was imported properly.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_4_slicerview.png" width="400">

* There are controls to select any plane orientation in space (XY, YZ, XZ), zoom, scroll through slices, and view time frames (if applicable).
* Check if the image shows misalignment across the channels in case of multichannel image (chromatic aberration) or drift in Z for 3D time series.

> *Chromatic aberration can be corrected in Huygens using the menu Deconvolution Chromatic Aberration Corrector.*<br>
> *The z-drift corrector tool is available as a part of deconvolution post-process for 3D time-series.*

**Tip**: If the image dimensions are not loaded correctly (for example, channels are read as slices) use the option *Tools > Convert* to set the right dimensions.

### Step 5: Microscopy parameters
{: .no_toc } 
* For a good deconvolution result, it is **extremely** important to have accurate microscopic parameters since these values are used to compute the PSF.
* Right-click on the image thumbnail and select *Microscopic parameters*. Alternative: *Edit > Edit Microscopic Parameters*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_5_launchmicroscopicparams.png" width="400">

* Parameters are read from the image metadata.
* Sometimes, the values from the metadata are not read out correctly. Check and correct the parameters.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_5_parameterwindow.png" width="400">

* Sub-windows (image below):
* (a) Here you can edit the general imaging parameters.
* (b) Here you can specify the microscope type as well as the excitation and emission wavelength for each acquired channel.

> *For a bandpass emission filter you can use the center wavelength.*<br>
> *Multiphoton images: select Widefield and set the Multi photon excitation to 2.*<br>
> *For standard microscopes the Excitation fill factor = 2 or higher.*<br>
> *For confocal microscope data the Backprojected pinhole (nm) should be calculated correctly from the metadata (but double-check!).*<br>

* (c) Here you can find the summary of your image data. 

<table>

     <td>(c)<br><img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_5c_parameterproperties.png" width="200" height="300"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* Once you have correctly set and verified the parameters, click on *Set all verified* followed by *Accept*. 

> *If you acquired multiple datasets with the same parameters, save them as a template for future use or batch processing.* <br>
> *The Load button serves to load a previously saved parameters template.*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_5_parametersverified.png" width="400">

**Tip 1**: For more information on the Huygens microscopic parameters click [here](https://svi.nl/MicroscopicParameters).

**Tip 2**: Huygens uses different background colors and the *Reports* window, to give you feedback about issues with your imaging settings or parameters.   

### Step 6: Deconvolution wizard
{: .no_toc } 
* Right-click on the image and select *Deconvolution Wizard*. Alternative: *Deconvolution > Deconvolution Wizard* or *Decon* icon on the task bar.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6_launchdeconwizard.png" width="400">

* On the start window of the wizard, you can see a summary of the previously defined paramaters. 
* The *Wizard status* window shows current status, warnings, etc.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6_deconwizardstart.png" width="400">

* Check if the parameters are correct and click on *Enter wizard*.

### Step 6a: Deconvolution wizard: PSF selection
{: .no_toc } 
* Huygens supports both measured and theoretical PSF. 

> *For thick samples, it is recommended to use theoretical PSF.* <br>
> *For badly aligned microscopes, better to use measured PSF.*

* This how-to-guide uses a calculated PSF. If you want to use a measured PSF it needs to be acquired and prepared before launching the deconvolution wizard. See section at the end of this page for a brief summary.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6a_importpsf.png" width="400">

* To let Huygens calculate the PSF from your image parameters (theoretical PSF), simply press *Next* (--->).

> *Calculated PSF works well and is recommended.*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6a_psfselection.png" width="400">


### Step 6b: Deconvolution wizard: Cropping
{: .no_toc } 
* Crop the 3D stack manually by using the *Launch the Cropper* option. 

> *The time needed to deconvolve an image increases proportionally with its volume.* <br>
> *Cropping helps to accelerate the process.*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6b_launchcropper.png" width="400">

* Alternatively, one can also use the *Auto crop* to let Huygens automatically detect a suitable region of interest.
* If you launched the *Cropper*, set the region of interest by adjusting the boundaries of the bounding box.
* Press on *Crop* on the bottom right of the window.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6b_cropper.png" width="400">

* Press *Next*.

### Step 6c: Deconvolution wizard: Select channel
{: .no_toc } 
* If you have more than one channel in your dataset, you will need to deconvolve them sequentially.
* On the left, you will see all the channels of your dataset.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6c_selectchannel.png" width="400">

* Select the first channel from the drop-down menu on the right and press *Next*.

### Step 6d: Deconvolution wizard: Inspecting the image histogram
{: .no_toc } 
* In this step, you will calculate and inspect the image intensity histogram of the selected channel.
* Select *Logarithmic* and click *Compute*.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6d_computehistogram.png" width="400">

* Huygens computes the histogram and displays it on the window next to the image.
* Huygens also provides important information on the intensity distribution.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6d_histogram.png" width="400">

* Inspect the histogram and the report before proceeding.

> *A tall peak on the extreme right of the histogram indicates clipping or saturation.* <br>
> *Clipping occurs when input signals that are too high and are mapped to the highest possible value* <br>
> *A tall peak on the very left of the histogram also indicates clipping, here the negative input signals are mapped to zero.* <br>
> *There can also be an offset at the left of the histogram indicating a positive blacklevel. This does not affect the deconvoluton results.* <br>

**Tip 1**: Save images as 16-bit to avoid clipping. 

**Tip 2**: Avoid deconvolution if there are large regions of saturated pixels. Check and make changes to your image acquisition settings. 


### Step 6e: Deconvolution wizard: Background estimation
{: .no_toc } 
* Estimate the background intensity of the channel. 
* There are two modes: *Automatic estimation* and *Manual mode.*
* It is **recommended to use** ***Automatic estimation***.

> *Confocal: set Estimation mode to 'Lowest'* <br>
> *Widefield: set Estimation mode to 'In/Near Object'*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6e_backgroundestimation.png" width="400">

* Set the *Estimation mode* and click on *Auto.*
* To provide a background value with manual measurement, click on *Manual*.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6e_manualbackground.png" width="400">

* Follow the instructions mentioned, enter the measured value in the *Background value* and click on *Accept*.


### Step 6f: Deconvolution wizard: Select deconvolution algorithm
{: .no_toc } 
* If the *Auto* mode for background estimation was used, you will find the results here.
* Select the *Deconvolution algorithm* to be used.

> *CMLE(Classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation): Robust, default method.* <br>
> *GMLE(Good’s roughness Maximum Likelihood Estimaion): Good for high-noise images. Uses more memory than CMLE* <br>
> *QMLE(Quick Maximum Likelihood Estimation): Fast, good for low-noise images.* <br>

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6f_deconvolutionalgorithm.png" width="400">

* Check the background estimate, select the deconvolution algorithm and click *Accept*.

**Tip**: **CMLE is generally recommended** for almost all kinds of images.  

### Step 6g: Deconvolution wizard: Setup deconvolution parameters
{: .no_toc } 
* The most important parameter that controls the deconvolution results is the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR.)
* The SNR determines the sharpness of the restoration result.

> *SNR too low: harmless but no sharpening* <br>
> *SNR too high: causes artifacts* <br>
> *Noise-free widefield image: SNR approx. > 50* <br>
> *Noisy confocal image: SNR approx. 15-20*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6g_snr.png" width="400">

* Adjust the *SNR* value.
* For the others, the defaults are set according to the image parameters and require no adjustments.

**Tip**: Check the [Huygens page](https://svi.nl/SignalToNoiseRatio) for more details.

### Step 6h: Deconvolution wizard: Preview and deconvolution
{: .no_toc } 
* Use the *Deconvolution preview* to check the results of current deconvolution parameters.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6h_deconvolutionlaunchpreview.png" width="400">

* The progress is visible in the *Reports* window on the left.
* In the image window, you can now see a yellow box which previews the result of deconvolution.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6h_deconvolutionpreview.png" width="400">

* You can move the box around to check the deconvolution preview from diffrent regions.

> *Check for artifacts. If seen, reduce the SNR and test the preview again.* <br>
> *If there is hardly any change in contrast, increase the SNR and run the preview.*

* If the preview looks good, click *Deconvolve*. This will start the deconvolution of the active channel.

**Tip**: The SNR should be seen as tunable parameter. The default is microscope-specific and a good start. But try different SNRs (10, 20, 40, 50), check the results and select the SNR which improves sharpness without enhancing noise.

### Step 6i: Deconvolution wizard: Deconvolution result
{: .no_toc } 
* When the deconvolution of your channel is done, you can see a preview of the result in the *Deconvolution result* step.
* Click *Accept, to next channel* to deconvolve the next channel of your dataset.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6i_nextchannel.png" width="400">

* For the next channel, the wizard starts at **Step 6c**.
* Perform a deconvolution for all channels of your dataset.
* After deconvolution of the last channel click *All done*.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6i_alldone.png" width="400">


### Step 6j: Deconvolution wizard: Select the results
{: .no_toc } 
* You can merge the deconvolved channels here.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6j_deconvolutionresults.png" width="400">

* Leave at default and click *Next*.

### Step 6k: Deconvolution wizard: Summary
{: .no_toc } 
* In the last step you can save your deconvolution parameters as a template. 

> *Useful if you plan to deconvolve multiple datasets of the same type.*

* Click *Done* to close the deconvolution wizard and return to the main window.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6k_summary.png" width="400">

* Alternatively, click on *Twin Slicer* icon to close the wizard and export the results directly for exploration.

> *One can also go to other the postprocessing steps such as Chromatic Aberration correction by clicking relevant icons.*

### Step 6l: Explore your results
{: .no_toc } 
* If you clicked *Done* in the previous step, you will return to the main window where you will see a new image thumbnail of the deconvolution result.
* Right-click on the thumbnail and select *Twin Slicer*.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6l_launchtwinslicer.png" width="400">

* Use the drop-down menu to select your raw dataset on the left and deconvolved dataset on the right.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6l_exploreresults.png" width="400">

* Compare the deconvolution result with the raw dataset.

### Step 6m: Saving your results
{: .no_toc } 
* **Do not forget to save images** before closing Huygens.
* Right-click the result image thumbnail and select *Save As*.

> *Recommended file-formats for saving: ICS2, TIFF 16-bit.*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6m_saveresult.png" width="400">

* A *Question* dialog asks you how you want to save your files. Usually *One per channel* is sufficient.

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6m_savequestion.png" width="400">

* Depending on the choosen file format and the intensities in your data, Huygens might also ask about the conversion mode.

> *Contrast stretch: good for visualization purposes and further analysis such as colocalization* <br>
> *Linked scale: use if you plan to perform ratiometric analysis.*

<img src="pics/huygens_deconvolution/huygens_6m_contrastmode.png" width="400">

**Tip**: Check the [Huygens webpage](https://svi.nl/TiffScaling) for more details on saving images as TIFF.

### Step 7: Quit Huygens
{: .no_toc } 
* Quit Huygens after usage by *File > Quit*. 

### Step 8: Logout
{: .no_toc } 
* Once you quit Huygens, you will return to the desktop of the remote machine.
* **Do not shut-down the computer**.
* Safely logout from the system using the ***drop-down next to the power button*** *> lmfuser > Log out*.

## Comment: Experimental PSF
Acquiring an experimental PSF can be useful, especially for badly aligned microscopes.
<br>
Brief summary of the required steps:
* Acquire images of fluorescent sub-resolution beads. Use the identical conditions and acquisition settings as for your raw data.
* Open the bead images in HuygensPro.
* Go to *Deconvolution > PSF Distiller Wizard* tool to compute the PSF from your bead image. 
* Once you finish, you will find a new thumbnail of the PSF in the main window.
* Launch the *Deconvolution Wizard*.
* At the *PSF Selection* step, choose *Import from main window* and select your PSF image.

**Tip**: To know more about PSF and PSF distiller, visit [Huygens Webpage](https://svi.nl/Huygens-PSF-Distiller).
